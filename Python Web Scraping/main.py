# what is web scraping?
# using any programming language and grabbing data from any website like grab data from Amazon, airbnb, any website can be scraped.
# Downloading web page -> grabbing data from that web page-> cleaning up somehow so that is useful for us using that data.


# ----------Web Scraping and APIs-----------
# we can scrape from any website but think if you make a website and you do a ton of reaserch and make a good product would you be like to scrapable or you have a good amount of users would you like to make it public, i assume no then there is a concept come robots.txt

# Robots.txt is a file that we tell googlebot or somekind of scraper or search engines bot don't touch this files
# search www.airbnb.com/robots.txt

# Best practice or we can say a ethical way to scrape a website is check robots.txt first, for what websites allows for scraping or what not.


# Two ways to scrape website
# 1. using APIs = it is given by websites or the data in a json format as a endpoints
# 2. using Html document

# How the GoogleBot work?
#  Google are crawling (Crawling is the process of finding new or updated pages to add to Google (Google crawled my website). One of the Google crawling engines crawls (requests) the page. The terms "crawl" and "index" are often used interchangeably, although they are different (but closely related) actions.)
# thats how when you search something like recipe or a some tools or anything else google is able to show us. and thats how SEO(search engine optimization.) works.
